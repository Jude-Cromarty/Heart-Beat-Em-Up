# Heart-Beat-Em-Up

Currently still in development.

Controls: WASDE for player 1,  IJKLO for player 2.

Theres scripts for stuff like health bars & timers I'll add when I add those components, but at the moment its mostly just a mix of stuff that needs assembling (Making the scripts so this should be super easy).

The art is not final and if you feel like there should be a feature either tell me or feel free to add it yourself. 

Because of time reasons, it's best if we reskin sprite sheets. https://www.spriters-resource.com/mobile/metalslugattack/ is a good place for this. They need walking, idle, attack and dead.

We need sound effects so if you find any add them, sort of depends on character first though.

To sync this, make a clone via Github desktop (need url) and work from the cloned location.
Remember to pull then commit when you make changes. 

The project is the folder inside the repo folder.
