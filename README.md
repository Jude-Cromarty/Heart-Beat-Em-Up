# Heart-Beat-Em-Up

Currently still in development.

Controls: QWASDE for player 1,  IJKLO for player 2.(Development Only) V to start & B to stop level rotation.

If you feel like there should be a feature either tell me or feel free to add it yourself. 

We need sound effects so if you find any add them.

To sync this, make a clone via Github desktop (need url) and work from the cloned location.
Remember to pull then commit when you make changes. 

The project is the folder inside the repo folder.
