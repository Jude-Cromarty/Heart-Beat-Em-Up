# Heart-Beat-Em-Up

Currently still in development.

Theres scripts for stuff like health bars & timers I'll add when I add those components, but at the moment its mostly just a mix of stuff that needs assembling (Making the scripts so this should be super easy).

The art is not final and if you feel like there should be a feature either tell me or feel free to add it yourself. 

Animations are needed mostly, currently I've just taken a gif, ran it through photoshop to split it apart and used parts of that.

We don't "Need" original characters/animations but they are prefrable

We need sound effects so if you find any add them, sort of depends on character first though.

To sync this, make a clone via Github desktop (need url) and work from the cloned location.
Remember to pull then commit when you make changes. 

The project is the folder inside the repo folder.
