# Heart-Beat-Em-Up

Currently still in development.
The art is not final and if you feel like there should be a feature either tell me or feel free to add it yourself. 
Animations are needed mostly, currently I've just taken a gif, ran it through photoshop to split it apart and used parts of that.
We don't "Need" original characters/animations but they are prefrable.

To sync this, make a clone via Github desktop (need url) and work from the cloned location. Remember to pull then commit when you
make changes.
